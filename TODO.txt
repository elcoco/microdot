# DONE don't show git dir as channel
# TODO make blacklist configurable
# DONE when linking or unlinking all, give a list of files before proceeding
# DONE when linking or unlinking all, filter file list
# DONE when internet is gone, gitpush will just skip. when internet reconnects, the push is not triggered again
# DONE when a linked encrypted file is updated when using watch, update decrypted file
# DONE when answered no when creating common channel, program crashes`

# DONE when a decrypted file is edited it needs to sync with the encrypted file
#      or changes get lost
#      When linking/init encrypted file, a warning needs to display about non running daemons

# DONE encryption only works for files now


# DONE use shorter base64 hashes
# DONE call StatusList LastSyncIndex
# DONE filter out CONFLICT files
# DONE add inspect function to inspect conflicted encrypted files
# DONE use channel/decrypted for decrypted files/dirs
# TODO when internet is back after a cut, wait a random amount of time.
#      this way we don't get conflicts when all devices start pushing at the same time
# DONE add info messages on normal operations, link, unlink etc
# DONE link/unlink all exists when files are already linked
#      when answering question a list of unlinked/linked files should display

#      md starts complaining
# DONE give nice list of conflicted files when listing
# DONE maybe move all constants to global state object
# DONE use columnize in list view
# DONE cleanup all tmp files/dirs in diff.py
# DONE make default channel configurable

#      -g for git sync and -s for sync without git
# DONE add warning to backup key when new key is created


# DONE add encrypt option to --link switch so we can encrypt an already initialized file
#      ask the user to remove file from git cache
# DONE add unencrypt option

# TODO if there are two encrypted paths with same filename, sync will alway say the first file is new
